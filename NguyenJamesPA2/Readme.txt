*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

This program takes in two lines of numbers from a text file.
Each line of integers goes into it's separate vector.
The two vectors then go through the union and intersection 
operations, creating two new vectors. The Union vector
is the combination of the first two without duplicates
while the Intersection vector is only the duplicates.

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  This is the driver program that reads in integers from a text file and separates
each line into its own respesctive vectors before creating a Union set vector and a Intersection set
vector.

Name:  Function.h
   Contains the declaration for the ReadFile, StringToVector, RunUnion, and RunIntersect functions.  

Name: Function.cpp
   Defines and implements the ReadFile, StringToVector, RunUnion, and RunIntersect functions.

*  How to build and run the program
*******************************************************

1. Uncompress the homework.  The homework file is compressed.  

   Now you should see a directory named homework with the files:
        main.cpp
        Function.h
        Function.cpp
        Readme.txt
	setInput.txt

2. Build the program.

3. Run the program.
